            <p>Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from large sets of data. 
                Data mining is the process of extracting knowledge or insights from large amounts of
                data using various statistical and computational techniques.
                data can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, 
                and can be stored in various forms such as databases, data warehouses
            </p>

                <h3><u>~Data mining on what kind of data</u></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relational databases</li>
                    <li>Dataware house<br></li>
                    <li>Transactional databases</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>-Relational databases:-</h4>
                <p>A relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. 
                Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. </p>

                <h4>-Dataware house:-</h4>
            <p>A data warehouse is an enterprise system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources, 
                such as point-of-sale transactions, marketing automation, customer relationship management, and more. 
                A data warehouse is suited for ad hoc analysis as well custom reporting

        <p>A data cube is a multi-dimensional data structure. A data cube is characterized by its dimensions (e.g., Products, States, Date). 
            Each dimension is associated with corresponding attributes</p>

    <h4>-Advanced systems or advanced databases:-</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>oriented database</li> 
        <li>Object relation database</li>
        <li>Databases and time series databases</li> 
        <li>Base and multimedia database</li> 
        <li>Heterogenous databases and legacy databases</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>-World wide web(WWW)</h4>
    <p>The World Wide Web contains a large amount of data that provides a rich source to data mining. 
    The objective of Web mining is to look for patterns in Web data by collecting and examining data in order to gain insights.

    <h4>Flat files</h4>
    <p>A flat file consists of a single table of data. It allows the user to specify data attributes, such as columns and data types table by table, and stores those attributes separate from applications. 
    This type of file is commonly used to import data in data warehousing projects

    <h3><u>~Data mining functionalities</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data characterization</li>
        <li>Data discrimination</li>
        <li>Association analysis</li>
        <li>Classification</li>
        <li>prediction</li>
        <li>Clustering</li>
        <li>Outlier analysis</li> 
        <li>Evolution Analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>-Data characterization:-</h4>
    <p>Data characterization is a summarization of the general characteristics or features of a target class of data. 
        The data corresponding to the user-specified class are typically collected by a query.
    </p>
    <h4>-Data discrimination:-</h4>
    <p>Data discrimination is a comparison of the general features of the target class data objects against the 
        general features of objects from one or multiple contrasting classes. 
    </p>
    <h4>-Association analysis:-</h4>
    <p>Looking for hidden relationships in large datasets is known as association analysis or association rule learning.
    The problem is, finding different combinations of items can be a time-consuming task and prohibitively expensive in terms of computing power.
    </p>
    <h4>-Classification</h4>
    <p>Classification in data mining is a technique used to assign labels or classify each instance, 
    record, or data object in a dataset based on their features or attributes. </p>
    <h4>-prediction:-</h4>
    <p>Predictive Data Mining is the Analysis done to predict a future event or multiple data or trends.
    It explains what might happen in the future as a result of past Data Analysis</p>
    <h4>-clustering:-</h4>
    <p>In clustering, a group of different data objects is classified as similar objects. One group means a cluster of data. 
        Data sets are divided into different groups in the cluster analysis, which is based on the similarity of the data.</p>

    <h4>-Outlier analysis:- </h4>
    <p>Outliers are discarded at many places when data mining is applied. But it is still used in many applications like fraud detection, medical, etc. 
    It is usually because the events that occur rarely can store much more significant information than the events that occur more regularly.</p>
    <h4>-Evolution Analysis:-</h4>
    <p>Evolution analysis refers to the description and model regularities or trends for objects whose behavior changes over time.</p>
